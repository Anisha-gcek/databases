# Image databases

This is a repository for two image databases that are used in classification of vehicle and detection of helmet use in public roads.

  * 2,576 images of non-motorcycles; and
  * 669 images of motorcycles.
 
The second database (we called `database2`)is divided as follow:

  * 151 images of motorcycles with helmets; and
  * 104 images of motorcycles without helmets.
